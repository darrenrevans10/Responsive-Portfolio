      <p><img id="profilepic" src="Assets/images/Profile Pic.jpg" alt="Profile Pic">

      I am a 24 year old working professional and student. I recently switched from full to part time at BASF as a data analyst in order to enroll and succeed in The Coding Boot Camp at UNC Chapel Hill. My new found passion in web development came while studying to get my BS from NC State. I graduated in 2016 with a degree in Business Administration and concentration in IT.
      <br>
      I recently became a house owner residing in the Brier Creek area as well as a first time pet owner of an Australian Shepherd named Koda. I am a sports fanatic, so in my spare time I enjoy both playing and watching many different sports. Some of my favorite teams include the OKC Thunder, Carolina Panthers, and Tarheel basketball. Other hobbies of mine include being a part of the craft beer scene and playing music with friends. Whenever I do get enough time on my hands and the weather is just right, I love going back home to the Outer Banks of NC.</p>
